 <p class="aboutme">
    Iâ€™m constantly learning new things everyday. Over the years Iâ€™ve learned how to play five instruments, paint, draw, design. I love hiking and recently learned how to ski!
I found my passion in design 6 years ago so I decided to earn my associates degree in graphic design. During my journey in graphic design I discovered UI/UX design and I found a passion for improving the lives of others through design. I  realized that this is the path that I wish to continue for the rest of my life.
I use my background in marketing, social media and customer service to come up with problem-solving ideas to help improve the user experience.
